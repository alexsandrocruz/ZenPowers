# Skills System

ZenPowers assumes Claude Code can auto-discover skills in this repository.
- `commands/*.md` are thin wrappers mapping to skills.
- `skills/**` hold canonical workflows.
- `SessionStart` bootstraps `using-zenpowers` skill (future).

> Note: Actual integration points may vary by Claude Code version.
